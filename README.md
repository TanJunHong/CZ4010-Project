## Encryption

XX

## Hash Verification

To authenticate the user, they are prompted to create a master password which is then stored using a SHA256 Hash
Function and is verified at login.

## Precautions

This password manager tool securely encrypts your password but this security is only as strong as the weakest component

- and this is very often the primary password used to lock and unlock your vault. Follow these basic guidelines to
  ensure that your vault is safe even if exposed:

* Choose a unique password that is not used elsewhere
* Use a highly-varied set of different characters (alpha-numeric, symbols, spaces)
* Use long password (the longer the better)
* Do not include personal information or words in the password
* Never share your password
